=head1 NAME

Test::Stream::Transition - How to transition from Test::Builder to Test::Stream

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document demonstrates how to transition code from Test::Builder to
Test::Stream. This is a list of things people frequently need to do, and how to
do them with both systems.

=head1 MAKE ASSERTIONS -> SEND EVENTS

=head2 LEGACY

    use Test::Builder;

    # A majority of tools out there do this:
    # my $TB = Test::Builder->new;
    # This works, but has always been wrong, forcing Test::Builder to implement
    # subtests as a horrific hack. It also causes problems for tools that try
    # to replace the singleton (also discouraged).

    sub my_ok($;$) {
        my ($bool, $name) = @_;
        my $TB = Test::Builder->new;
        $TB->ok($bool, $name);
    }

    sub my_diag($) {
        my ($msg) = @_;
        my $TB = Test::Builder->new;
        $TB->diag($msg);
    }

=head2 STREAM

    use Test::Stream qw/context/;

    sub my_ok($;$) {
        my ($bool, $name) = @_;
        my $ctx = context();
        $ctx->ok($bool, $name);
    }

    sub my_diag($) {
        my ($msg) = @_;
        $ctx->diag($msg);
    }

The context object has API compatible implementations of the following methods:

=over 4

=item ok($bool, $name)

=item diag(@messages)

=item note(@messages)

=item subtest($name, $code)

L<Test::Stream::More::Tools>.

=head1 WRAP EXISTING TOOLS

=head2 LEGACY

    use Test::Mote;

    sub exclusive_ok {
        my ($bool1, $bool2, $name) = @_;

        # Ensure errors are reported 1 level higher
        local $Test::Builder::Level = $Test::Builder::Level + 1;

        $ok = $bool1 || $bool2;
        $ok &&= !($bool1 && $bool2);
        ok($ok, $name);

        return $bool;
    }

Every single tool in the chain from this, to C<ok>, to anything C<ok> calls
needs to increment the C<$Level> variable. When an error occurs Test::Builder
will do a trace to the stack frame determined by C<$Level>, and report that
file+line as the one where the error occured. If you or any other tool you use
forgets to set C<$Level> then errors will be reported to the wrong place.

=head2 STREAM

    use Test::Mote;

    sub exclusive_ok {
        my ($bool1, $bool2, $name) = @_;

        # Grab and store the context, even if you do not need to use it
        # directly.
        my $ctx = context();

        $ok = $bool1 || $bool2;
        $ok &&= !($bool1 && $bool2);
        ok($ok, $name);

        return $bool;
    }

Instead of using C<$Level> to perform a backtrace, Test::Stream uses a context
object. In this sample you create a context object and store it. This locks the
context (errors report 1 level up from here) for all wrapped tools to find. You
do not need to use the context object, but you do need to store it in a
variable. Once the sub ends the C<$ctx> variable is destroyed which lets future
tools find their own.

=head1 USING UTF8

=head2 LEGACY

    # Set the mode BEFORE anything loads Test::Builder
    use open ':std', ':encoding(utf8)';
    use Test::More;

Or

    # Modify the filehandles
    my $builder = Test::More->builder;
    binmode $builder->output,         ":encoding(utf8)";
    binmode $builder->failure_output, ":encoding(utf8)";
    binmode $builder->todo_output,    ":encoding(utf8)";

=head2 STREAM

    use Test::Stream 'utf8';

or

    use Test::Stream encoding => 'utf8'; # Or any other encoding

or

    use Test::Stream qw/tap_encoding/;

    # Use utf8 for one result
    tap_encoding('utf8');
    ok(1, "SOMETHING UTF8");

    # Go back to the legacy encoding
    tap_encoding('legacy');
    ok(1, "Something ASCII");

With Test::Stream encoding is flexible and can be changed as needed.
